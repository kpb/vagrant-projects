# Tor Browser Box

Creates a light(er) weight Debian/LXDE box with the Tor browser installed. Easy to create and destroy, and to isolate
from your host machine for better security.

## Running

`vagrant up`. The box takes a while to download all of its dependencies and will reboot to make the GUI available.

Login with `vagrant:vagrant` and launch the tor browser from the _start_ menu, select one of the built-in bridges, and
connect. Enjoy some security!
