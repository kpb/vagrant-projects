## Java Dev Box

A Java development box based on [ubuntu/jammy64][jammy-box]. Installs and configures a bunch of dev tools including: _KinD, kubectl, mob.sh, SDKMAN, Git, etc._

### Running

Set versions and other configuration in the `versions.sh` file.

`up` the box with:

```bash
$ vagrant up
```

This may take a while, depending on the speed of your internet connection.

Enjoy!
